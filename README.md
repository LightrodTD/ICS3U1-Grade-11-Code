# ICS3U1-Grade-11-Code
This repository consist of 3 assignments that I completed for the course ICS3U1.

The 1st assignment has 3 seperate problems to solve, labeled as Q1, Q2, Q3. They solve simple question about area, angles, and projectiles.

The 2nd assignment is a 2D platformer video game. The game runs on MonoGame, but there may be issues with running it now. Unfortunately, you most likley will only be able to view how I programmed my game

The 3rd assignment is an application for string manipulation and binary-base 10 number convertor.
